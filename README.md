## IN104 Project: Bomberman

Implementation of the classic game Bomberman in C using SDL2.
This project is part of the course IN104 teached at ENSTA Paris

## Dependencies
Currently, only Linux and Mac Os are supported.

This game uses SDL2, SDL_net, SDL_image and SDL_ttf. You need to install those libraries on your machine in order to play the game.
For general explications you can follow [the SDL documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation).
For systems using apt you can run the following command:

```sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-net-2.0-0 libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-dev```


### Running the game

Clone the repository, go into the src subfolder and run ```make``` to launch the game.

If you have already compiled once, you can run ./main.exe for faster execution.

## Choosing your map

Maps are currently stored in maps/

You can select which map you want to play one by running ```./main.exe ../maps/FILE```
