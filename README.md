## Projet IN104: Bomberman

Implementation of the famous game Bomberman in C using SDL2.
Use arrows or zqsd to move across the map and SPACE to place bombs.

Currently there are only three powerups but more is coming ;)

Multiplayer support in under development


### Running the game

Clone the repository, go into the src subfolder and run ```make``` to launch the game.

If you have already compiled once, you can run ./main.exe for faster execution.
